1;For the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it.  The television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids. So they can lough and be happy. They show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something, and the children are learning something. But also there are some advertising that aren´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave. Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldn´t learn. A situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and don´t know what he could do. He saw an advertising where this happend and the solution was that the child hurt the other one, and that is not ok. In reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car. So it´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it.
